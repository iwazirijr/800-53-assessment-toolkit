# USGov RMF Toolkit

**Disclaimer:** I am not the original creator of some of these resources.

--
These are collection of my personal tools, and publicly available resources (from multiple sources) meant to facilitate the USGov Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RMF) process.

The toolkit includes:

- Control implementation guides following NIST 800-53 control sets.
- Control Assessment guide following NIST 800-53A
- ATO Package Templates from FedRAMP and other publicly sources
- Personal templates, tools and scripts I have used over-time.

**Note:** Some of these might be outdated, especially some of the templates and guidance. Please validate and verify before you proceed to using these.
