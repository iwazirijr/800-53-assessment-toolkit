# Cybersecurity Toolkit

These are a collection of my personal and open-source/publicly available resources/tools I use for managing US Government Cybersecurity process (including FedRAMP RMF, NIST RMF, DoD RMF, and IC RMF), Building ATO Packages, Implementing Security Controls, Assessing Security Controls, Hardening/STIG'ing Environments etc.

## Content

The toolkit includes:
- Control implementation guides following NIST 800-53 control sets.
- Control Assessment guide following NIST 800-53A
- ATO Package Templates from FedRAMP and other publicly sources
- Personal templates, tools and scripts I have used over-time.
- Hardening and STIG scripts - Most of the scripts are forked from SANS repo. The files contains some of the lab files for for the SANS Institute course [SEC505: Securing Windows and PowerShell Automation](https://sans.org/sec505).
