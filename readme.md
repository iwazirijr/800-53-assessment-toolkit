# USGov RMF Toolkit

These are collection of my personal tools, and publicly available resources (from multiple sources) meant to facilitate the USGov Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RMF) process.

**Disclaimer:** I am not the original creator of some of these resources.

**Note:** Some of these might be outdated, especially some of the templates and guidance. Please validate and verify before you proceed to using these.

This toolkit includes:

- Control implementation guides following NIST 800-53 control sets.
- Control Assessment guide following NIST 800-53A
- ATO Package Templates from FedRAMP and other publicly sources
- Personal templates, tools and scripts I have used over-time.
- Hardening and STIG scripts - Most of the scripts are forked from SANS repo. The files contains some of the lab files for for the SANS Institute course [SEC505: Securing Windows and PowerShell Automation](https://sans.org/sec505). For more information about the Windows security and PowerShell at SANS, please visit https://sans.org/sec505. Please read the readme, legal, and setup sections of these hardening/stig scripts.
