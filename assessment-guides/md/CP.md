> and reconstitution of the information system to a known state after a
> disruption, compromise, or failure.
>
> Control Translation: Ensure the organization have mechanisms in place
> for the recovery and reconstitution of the information system to a
> known state after a disruption, compromise, or failure.
>
> Notes: Recovery is executing information system contingency plan
> activities to restore essential missions and business functions.
> Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities
> for returning the information system to its original functional state
> before contingency plan activation. Recovery and reconstitution
> procedures are based on organizational priorities, established
> recovery point/time and reconstitution objectives, and appropriate
> metrics. Reconstitution includes the deactivation of any interim
> information system capability that may have been needed during
> recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes an assessment of the
> fully restored information system capability, a potential system
> reauthorization and the necessary activities to prepare the system
> against another disruption, compromise, or failure. Recovery and
> reconstitution capabilities employed by the organization can be a
> combination of automated mechanisms and manual procedures. Related
> controls: CA-2, CA-6, CA-7, SC-24.

> How to test and evaluate: Examine SSP and Contingency Planning Policy
> (if available) and verify that documents identify that organization
> have mechanisms in place for the recovery and reconstitution of the
> information system to a known state after a disruption, compromise, or
> failure. Verify and note whether information system implements
> transaction recovery for systems that are transaction-based (database
> management systems and transaction processing systems are examples of
> information systems that are transaction-based. Transaction rollback
> and transaction journaling are examples of mechanisms supporting
> transaction recovery). Verify if there are compensating security
> controls are in place, if there is capability to reimage that is
> controlled and is integrity protected disk images representing a
> secure and operational state, and if there is real-time or
> near-real-time failover (mirrored) capability at an alternate
